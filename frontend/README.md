# Vue TS Frontend

Frontend was built with Vue, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Pinia.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue**

Vue is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the application's state efficiently. It can easily integrate with other libraries and projects.

- **Vite**

Vite is a fast build tool for modern web development. It provides instant server start and hot module replacement (HMR), making the development experience smoother and more productive.

- **TypeScript**

TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code maintainability and scalability. It allows us to catch errors during development and provides better tooling support, leading to more robust applications.

- **Tailwind CSS**

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development. Its utility classes make it easy to create responsive and custom-designed user interfaces without writing custom CSS.

- **Pinia**

Pinia is a state management pattern and library for Vue.js applications. It provides an intuitive way to manage application state, making it easier to build complex UIs with Vue.

The goal of using these technologies is to create a high-performing, modern and scalable application.
